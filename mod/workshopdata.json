  "Title": "[Beta] The Escort",
  "Description": "A mod that will add The Escort and (eventually) their very special slugpup.\r\n[i]Thank You Eclipse Shadow Scale for the headshot![/i]\r\n\r\nCurrently implements The Escort and some of their abilities and movement tech. \r\n[i]Should[/i] be fully compatible for playing in other campaigns or arena.\r\n\r\n[b]Feedback of any sort is HIGHLY appreciated![/b]\r\n\r\nFound a bug? Put it in the forums or reach me in Discord! I\u0027m in the main RW discord server (as [b]Deathpits[/b]). Feel free to ping me!\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr][h2]\u003C~DISCLAIMER~\u003E[/h2]\r\nEscort\u0027s campaign doesn\u0027t exist, there\u0027s no custom assets, and this may or may not alter the behaviour of other slugcats by pure accident (it\u0027s unlikely for this to happen)...\r\n[hr][/hr][h2]\u003C~CONFLICTING MODS/KNOWN ISSUES~\u003E[/h2]\r\nThese mods may or may not cause issues with the Escort mod, or these are issues that have been found and will be fixed eventually\r\n[list]\r\n[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2924848641]Rico Spear[/url]: [b]Apparently causes Brawler Escort to explode when shanking[/b] (Confirmed to kill Brawler Escort upon \u0022shanking\u0022)\r\n[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2931679448]SimplifiedMoveset[/url]: [b]Affects Escort gameplay significantly![/b] Many of Escort\u0027s movement adjustments don\u0027t work when this is turned on, such as the sick flip and low pounce (which makes aiming drop-kicks harder). Use at your own risk!\r\n[*] [b]Campaign:[/b] Garbage Waste doesn\u0027t work properly\r\n[*] [b]Campaign:[/b] When playing COOP in Escort\u0027s Campaign, the food intake doesn\u0027t work properly (gives you too much food actually)\r\n[*] [b]Campaign:[/b] Escort starts in water... that\u0027ll be fixed once I make a custom room.\r\n[*] [b]General:[/b] Spearthrowing mechanics are still a wee bit janky and needs cleanup.\r\n[*] [b]Campaign:[/b] Upon entering Moon\u0027s chamber, the game will soft-crash (this is recoverable by using warp mod to warp to a different room)\r\n[*] [b]Campaign:[/b] Moon\u0027s structure\u0027s physics are borken\r\n[*] And probably more, there are way too many mods to test this character with...\r\n[/list]\r\n[hr][/hr][h2]\u003C~PATCHED MODS~\u003E[/h2]\r\nThis mod will apply a patch to work better with the following mods. How they change the behaviour of the Escort mod is as detailed (Any mods not listed in either conflicts or patched may be assumed to be working):\r\n[list]\r\n[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2950327774]Revivify[/url]: [b]Somewhat patched for 1.2.0[/b] (Doesn\u0027t work as well on slugpups...)\r\n[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2948971756]Dress My Slugcat 1.4.X[/url]: [b]Patched![/b] (Custom sprite ready? Who knows.)\r\n[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2928004252]Rotund World 1.6.X[/url]: [b]Doesn\u0027t need patching really, but added a silly sfx and the chest marking stretch with the body![/b]\r\n[/list]\r\n[*] [url=][/url]: [b][/b] ()\r\n[hr][/hr][h2]\u003C~CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED~\u003E[/h2]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] REMIX MENU to tweak some features and enable optional gimmicks\r\n[*] Builds that alter how the character plays\r\n[*] Custom sprites\r\n[*] Slide Stun (sliding into creature)\r\n[*] Drop Kick (roll/slide pouncing into creature)\r\n[*] Flip Pounce (charge pounce)\r\n[*] Flip wall jump (holding up or down and direction (towards the wall) while on the wall, then pressing jump after a bit)\r\n[*] Infinite roll (that speeds up!)\r\n[*] Dual wield spears (and dead lizards)\r\n[*] Parryslide! (Sliding will parry most damage, including explosives!)\r\n[*] Battle-Hyped: Keep your tired meter above a threshhold by engaging in combat to become stronger and faster. Let that adrenaline PUMP!\r\n[*] Arc\u0027d Spear (Monk throwing trajectory, Survivor damage (and way more when hyped!), (lesser) Gourmand forward thrust)\r\n[*] Custom (silly) SFX!\r\n[/list]\r\n[hr][/hr][h2]\u003C~TO BE IMPLEMENTED (near future!)~\u003E[/h2]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Escort will be able to throw better in water\r\n[*] Escort\u0027s swim speed is actually affected by their base movement speed\r\n[*] Dropkicks will be affected by bodyweight!\r\n[*] Lizards grabbing Escort while they\u0027re holding the lizard will no longer do a funky dance\r\n[*] [i]Something special at 1.5k subscribers[/i] ;\u003E\r\n[/list]\r\n[hr][/hr][h2]\u003C~BUILD STATUSES~\u003E[/h2]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] [b]Default:[/b] May need some buffs\r\n[*] [b]Brawler:[/b] Needs patches and nerfs\r\n[*] [b]Deflector:[/b] In a fine place\r\n[*] [b]Escapist:[/b] In a fine place\r\n[*] [b]Railgunner:[/b] Needs a tiny bit of adjustments\r\n[*] [b]Speedster:[/b] Needs patches and adjustments\r\n[/list]\r\n[hr][/hr][h2]\u003C~GOALS~\u003E[/h2]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Add some fun gimmicks for Escort (All hostile creatures know what room you\u0027re in, harvest armor from centipedes, etc.)\r\n[*] Add the special slugpup and their set AI\r\n[*] Complete the campaign\r\n[/list]\r\n[hr][/hr][h3]\u003C~REPOSITORY~\u003E[/h3]\r\n[url=https://github.com/urufu765/rw-scb-TheEscort]Enjoy!
